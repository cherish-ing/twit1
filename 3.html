<h2>JavaScript</h2>
<p><strong>JavaScript (English: JavaScript)</strong> is an object-based script programming language.
<br>It is also used in server side network programming, such as runtime environments such as Node.js.
<br>JavaScript was originally developed by Netscape Communications Corporation's Brendan Eich under the name Mocha and later by LiveScript, which eventually became JavaScript.
<br>Although Javascript's syntax is similar to that of Sun Microsystems' Java, this is in fact because both languages are based on the basic syntax of C language, and Java and JavaScript are not directly related.
<br>Aside from his name and phrase, he has more similarities with self or skim than Java.</p>

<p>As of January 2013, the latest version is JavaScript 1.8.5 and is supported on [3], Firefox 3.
<br>The JavaScript version corresponding to the standard ECMA-262 3rd edition is 1.5.
<br>ECMA Script is a standardized version of JavaScript, to put it simply.
<br>With the release of Mozilla 1.8 Beta 1, we have partial support for E4X (ECMA-357), an extension language that responds to XML.
