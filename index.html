<h2>Welcome to the WEB site!</h2>
<p>It is an information search system that enables information on the Internet to be retrieved in hypertext and multimedia environments.
It is the most prevalent system in the world that effectively searches for various information on the Internet expressed in hypertext format.</p>

<p>Hypertext will appear to be a Web browser that reads pieces of information, such as "documents" or web pages, from a Web server and outputs them to a computer monitor. The user can then follow the hyperlinks on each page to another document, or send a series of information to the server that serves the page. Moving along hyperlinks is often referred to as web surfing (web surfing, cultural language: mangyuram[2]) or web browsing. And a collection of web pages that contain related content is called Web sites.</p>

<p>The English word "worldwide" is usually used as one word without spaces or hyphens, but the World Wide Web and its acronym, WWW, are used as official English words.</p>

<p>The World Wide Web can be summarized into three functions: How to position the first unified web resource e.g. URL. Protocol access to the resource name of the second web e.g. HTTP, language that can easily navigate between resources, for example HTML</p>
