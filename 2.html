<h2>CSS</h2>
Traditional HTML has many limitations in designing and changing web documents from time to time, and it is the style sheet that is designed to complement it and the standard for style sheet is the CSS. Simply referred to as a style sheet.
<br>Web pages should be created using HTML, but if you save the web page's writing format in advance, the entire page will be changed at once, allowing consistency across documents and shorter work time.
<br>Thus, web developers can design the Web with a richer design, freely select or change the size of the letters, font, spacing, background color, and location of the arrangement, and keep and repair them simple.
